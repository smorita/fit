# Five Intersecting Tetrahedra

[Five Intersecting Tetrahedra](http://origametry.net/fit.html) (FIT) by Thomas Hull is my favorite origami masterpiece.
I have used a photo of FIT created by myself as my icon.

This repository is for scripts drawing FIT in a web browser using the JavaScript 3D library, [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
Please check [the GitHub page](https://smorita.github.io/fit/).
You can move viewpoint by a mouse and a touchscreen.
It's also interesting to go inside the FIT.
